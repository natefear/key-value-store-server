# Key/Value Store Server
A simple key/value store server in C using TCP/IP and Telnet

The server uses syncronized POSIX threads to allow clients to access and manipulate the key/value store safely and concurrently.
A PDF report has been included within the repository detailing how the threads have been syncronized.
